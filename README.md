**Fraud Detection Using K-Means Clustering**
This project applies unsupervised machine learning using K-Means clustering in PySpark to detect potential fraud in financial transactions. 
The implementation supports experimentation with different core levels and dataset sizes, and benchmarks runtime and accuracy for performance analysis.

**Project Highlights**
Uses Apache Spark for scalable distributed processing

K-Means clustering on financial transaction features

Manual label-cluster mapping for accuracy evaluation

Outputs runtime, accuracy, and overhead statistics

Compatible with local multi-core execution

Benchmarked using speedup.csv and scaleup.csv
